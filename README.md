# odin-calculator
Calculator for The Odin Project. Currently fully functional as a 4 function calculator. Allows operation chaining and repeat operations by pressing = repeatedly. Can handle very large and very small numbers with exponential notation, though resolution is lost. 

This is a rewrite of my first functional version of odin-calculator, using object-oriented principles to organize the code. Functionality is the same aside from a few bug fixes. The goal of the rewrite was to practice using abstraction and seperation of concerns to create more modular code.
