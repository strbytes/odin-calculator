# odin-calculator
Calculator project for The Odin Project. Currently fully functional as a 4 function calculator. Allows operation chaining and repeat operations by pressing = repeatedly. Can handle very large and very small numbers with exponential notation, though all resolution is lost. Percent key divides the number on the screen by 100 without affecting other operations.
